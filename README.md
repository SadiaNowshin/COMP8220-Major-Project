# COMP8220-Major-Project
COMP8220 Machine Learning Major Project: s noted in the project Description, It worked on a dataset of human faces.  The images have dimensionality 100x100, and are (mostly) colour.
The data is split into train_images.npy, val_images.npy and test_images.npy, with a test_private_images.npy to come later.  Labels are also available for the training data and validation data, in train_labels.npy and val_labels.npy respectively.  (npy files are a standard format for files using numpy.)  
The labels have the form x-y, where
x is an identifier specific to an individual; and
y is the part of the label that corresponds to age.
